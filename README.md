# License Plate Recognition using YOLOv8 and EasyOCR

This project aims to perform License Plate Recognition (LPR) using the YOLOv8 object detection model and EasyOCR for Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project has been sourced from Roboflow. It includes a collection of images containing various license plates.

## Model Training

The YOLOv8 model has been utilized to train on the dataset for license plate detection. The trained model is then used to identify license plates within images.

## Installation

To set up and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Badal-Jha/Licence-plate-detection.git

2. Go to current directory
   
cd /content/Licence-Plate-Detection-and-Recognition-using-YOLO-V8-EasyOCR

2. Install all project dependencies by running:
   
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

In the code, regular expressions (regex) are applied to select Indian license plate formats. The regex pattern is designed to match the typical Indian license plate structure.
